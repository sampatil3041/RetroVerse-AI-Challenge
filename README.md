## 💡 Project Description
RetroVerse OS is a web-based operating system that looks like Windows 95 but features a "Sentient" AI core. It bridges the gap between static retro interfaces and modern intent-based computing.

## 🤖 AI Features
1. **CORTEX Chatbot (New):** A natural language bot (Eye Icon) that controls the OS. Try typing: "Activate hacker mode", "Open calculator", or "I need to focus".
2. **Intent Detection:** If you open coding tools (Terminal), the OS automatically shifts to "Focus Mode" (High Contrast).
3. **Smart Integration:** If you calculate a number in the Calculator, the AI offers to save it to your Notes automatically.
4. **Pattern Recognition:** If you use an app repeatedly, the AI learns and offers to automate it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- LocalStorage for file persistence
